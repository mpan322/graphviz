 - Write function to automatically call the dot programme to display the generated graph and open an external window from within gap.
 - Flesh out tests
 - (*) Add a mode which will output the dot representation after every modification to make editing easier (not sure how feasible this is)
 - Potentially merge / minimize attribute declarations when possible 
 (not needed but may be nice)
 - Implement loading from a file

## Issues
 - Not super happy with the current subgraph implementation, its a bit wonky but does work.

## Bug
- Make sure no holes related problems when generating the output string.
